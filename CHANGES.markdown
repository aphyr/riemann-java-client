0.5.1
=====

* Upgraded dropwizard metrics to 4.0.2

0.5.0
=====

* Upgrade to Netty 4

NOTES:

- See [Netty 4](http://netty.io/wiki/new-and-noteworthy-in-4.0.html) upgrade notes


- As [mentioned](http://netty.io/wiki/new-and-noteworthy-in-4.0.html#write-does-not-flush-automatically)
  Netty 4 won't flush sends automatically. By default this client will flush after each message,
  this can be controlled via the `autoFlush` field on the Transports.

- `Resolver` class was removed. Netty will resolve on each new channel when the
  supplied address is created via `InetSocketAddress.createUnresolved`.

- use of `HashedWheelTimer` has been replaced by the Executor provided by the
  `ChannelHandlerContext`

- Previous versions used to explicitly disable SSL TLS renegotiation. This no longer appears to be part of Netty.
  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31418644/is-it-possible-to-disable-tls-renegotiation-in-netty-4)
  suggests setting the JDK8+ System Property `jdk.tls.rejectClientInitiatedRenegotiation`

- Use individual Netty Jars rather than netty-all. Use of netty-all can hinder
  dependency resolution when different projects use Netty on the same classpath.
  See example from [Aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/issues/335)

- Remove `ChannelGroupHandler` the Transport connect add the channel at each connection attempt.
  The Netty `Channels` class automatically removes channels as they close.

* Enable metrics reports to include state values based on the values of
  the metrics. This adds support for computation and reporting of metric
  states. The implementation associates ranges of values with user-defined
  states, defaulting to `ok` if no filters have been set up or none of the
  associated filters applies.
